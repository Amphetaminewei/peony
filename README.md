# About third-party open source codes
I used some third-party code and modified it to fit into my project.

The 3rd parties codes would been placed in project's ${top-src-dir}/3rd-parties directory.

Note that peony-qt/libpeony-qt might use different license (GPL/LGPL) with a 3rd parties' license. I will keep those 3rd parties codes' Copyrights and Licenses.
